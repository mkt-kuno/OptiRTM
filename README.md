We have created a program for reverse time migration in seismic exploration using a two-dimensional elastic wave propagation model.　

# Characteristics
## Reverse time migration program for seismic exploration
Reverse Time Migration(RTM) is a seismic wave inversion method that calculates reflection cross sections by combining (closs-correlation, convolution, etc...) seismic wave forward and backward propagation data by the observed waveform and source.
This program implements RTM using seismic wave forward propagation modeling and backward propagation equation of P-SV wave and SH wave.
## Python + JIT Optimization (Numba) 
While based on Python, high-performance parallel processing is achieved using Numba's JIT compilation with CPU multi-threading.

# Examples 
Sample waveform file in np.array format. Analysis procedure was shown in example.py.  
example rho model　　　　　　　　　　calculated closs-section of example

# How to use
**1. Input data**  
 Prepare record waveforms in np.array format  
**2. Parameter settings**  
 Set parameters such as the size of the analysis area, sampling rate, wave velocity, and source location (See example.py)  
**3. RTM execution**  
 Call the core functions of RTM using NumPy arrays with Numba JIT acceleration. The wave is propagated forward and backward, and the imaging results are generated according to the imaging conditions (e.g., cross-correlation). The result files are output in npz format  
**4. Visualization of the results**  
 Load the npz file of the results, apply stacking and surface noise removal as necessary, and draw the reflection cross-section.  
 imaging.py uses matplotlib and other tools to output images

# Contributions
We welcome issues and pull requests at any time. Please feel free to contact us with bug reports, feature requests, etc.

# Future Prospects
We are working on setting up the system so that it can be run on different file formats, such as sg2 files.
